## How To Use

To run this script, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Next open up your terminal and from your command line type:

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/isaccanedo/cryptocurrency-colors.git

# Go into the cryptocurrency-colors directory
$ cd cryptocurrency-colors

# Run the script
$ node example.js
```

In `example.js` is shown how you can use the cryptocurrency color database. You can of course just grab the `cryptocurrency-colors.json` file and use that in your project however you like it.
